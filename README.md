Install with the command:

devtools::install_github("BenBruyneel/proteinDiscover")

Latest update (v0.8.0) : finally the package has tests to help development & checking for problems due to eg dependency updates

Currently I'm looking into making the naming of function arguments etc a bit more consistent throughout the entire package

Work in progress!
